					<h2 >Space Simulation (Python) </h2>
					<article>
					My Space Simulation application is an approximate demo of the real life physics in outer-space, and is made with the Pygame framework on Python. 
					There are many details considered in this real life simulation. 
					The size of planets, their gravitational pull, distance affecting gravitational pull, moons are some of the factors considered.
					A heavy focus of the application is on the rate of change of the spaceship, and moons.
					This includes proper acceleration, and velocity.
					This application is not yet finished, as it need collisions, and  a few more concepts, which I will complete once I have a the time.
